Title: Embracing Change: A Pivotal Moment

Life is an intricate tapestry of chapters, each marked by pivotal moments that signal a shift in direction. Stepping into the unknown is never a simple feat, especially when faced with significant changes or extraordinary opportunities. Who among us hasn't stood before an open door, contemplating the path that led us there, filled with memories, nostalgia, and a whirlwind of emotions?

This piece meticulously crafted by the collaborative efforts of the Media Design students encapsulates precisely this moment. The result is a looping chain reaction, filled with videos and animations connected by smooth transitions, which weave a touching story.

At the heart of the storyline lies a protagonist poised on the brink of a transformative journey—having secured admission to the FH to pursue their dream. As they stand on the threshold of departure, a final gaze is cast upon their childhood room, a space saturated with memories and nostalgia. The narrative unfolds as the protagonist reminisces about lively game nights, takes a lingering look at a cherished childhood book, and daydreams about leaving the familiar confines of home behind to embrace a new life in Graz.
