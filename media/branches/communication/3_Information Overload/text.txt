This magazine is an Information Overload for all your senses! It is not just about how social media or advertisements overwhelm everybody’s eyes or ears. It overloads your eyes, ears, hands, nose and tongue. Join a travel into variable pages where you can read images, noise, surfaces, smell and flavors. Through different approaches you can experience and escape the overload. There is an interview with eyes, a poem about the contrast of noise and silence, coping techniques, memories in combination with scents, a text about where the … go and much more. The style is a mix of everything, a collage of everyday life. Immerse into the volume of your senses!
